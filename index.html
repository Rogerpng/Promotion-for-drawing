      <h3>A Summary</h3>
      <article>
        <p>It all started with a dream of learning to code, so after a month or two of learning to code in diffrent programs one of my final programs was to make a drawing program. <br>
        I'm going to be real, I think this was not the optimal time to learn a whole new skill, especially with the quarter system the school has put in. But thats getting off track.</br>
       I made a <strong>case study</strong> to start off the program so i could figure out what I wanted the program to look like and what I wanted to code, next I worked on the basics, like the canvas, colour buttons, and lineart buttons. </p>
