    <header><h1>The Concept began as I had to do a drawing program</h1></header>
      <nav><h1>Ok no, if we get serious for a moment, I like to draw on paper for pretty much my whole life, so I got really invested in this drawing program</h1></nav>
      <li> Make a plan on pen and paper (Like my CaseStudy)
      <li> Setup the 'foundation' for the project
      <li> and finally, you need some stamina to push through
